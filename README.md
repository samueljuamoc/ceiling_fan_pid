# ceiling_fan_pid
MPLAB project using XC8 compiler and PIC18F4550 microcontroller
Here I use the PIC microcontroller as a DAQ: Reading its inputs, transmitting data values readed via UART protocol, then receiving the data generated by a PID LabVIEW module and using it to rewrite the outputs of the DAQ.
